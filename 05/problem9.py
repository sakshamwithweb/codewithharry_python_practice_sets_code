# Can you change the values inside a list which is contained in set S?
s = {8, 7, 12, "Harry", [1, 2]}

# Answer: We could add or delete items in Set but cannot replace, as it is unindexed and onordered so we cannot point element at specific index as well as it doesn't have any method which could replaceor change any element
