# Use comparison operator to find out whether ‘a’ given variable a is greater than ‘b’ or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80

# Numbers
a = 34
b = 80

result = a > b # > is a comparison operator which tells whether number in left side is greater than right side or not, returns boolean

print("Is a greater than b:", result)
